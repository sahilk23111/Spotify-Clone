 I created a front-end replica of Spotify using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, achieving 95% visual similarity to the original platform. The project included dynamic UI elements like a responsive navigation bar, music player controls, playlists, and album artwork. This clone enhanced my front-end development skills by focusing on pixel-perfect design and improving user experience through smooth transitions and interactive features. It also provided valuable insights into building scalable and visually appealing web applications.
